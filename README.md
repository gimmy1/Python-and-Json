# Working with JSON Data and Python

This repository contains a little exercise working with Python and JSON.

I make a request to JSONPlaceholder, a great source of fake JSON data for practice purposes.

I make a request to the JSON API storing into `todos` list.

I then create a dictionary of users and their count of completed items. Sort, in descending order, by those who have completed the most.

`max_number` returns 12

I pass a custom function into filter to return a list that contains data of users who have completed all 12 todo items.

I then dump (encode) to a json file `filtered_data_file`
